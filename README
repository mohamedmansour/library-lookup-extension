Montreal Open Data Hackathon (Nov 2011)

We wanted to do something interesting and helpful with the newly released library data: a 1GB tab-separated flat file with 4.5M records of 19 fields.

We decided to build a browser extension which would augment the web pages of online book stores to display library availability of the books shown.

We implemented a Chrome extension for the book store http://www.renaud-bray.com/ but other browsers (e.g. Firefox) and book stores (e.g. Amazon.ca) could follow.

We also implemented a small web service to query library availability by ISBN; ideally this would be replaced by an official web service for accessing live data.

This repo includes only a sample of the data: ISBNs 3829062699, 0385333536, 9748279804, 9782800101019, 9782800101095.

You can find the original data here:

We had a great time and hope you find this hack useful.
